# vim: syntax=sh filetype=sh :
#
# Non-specific/common (bash & zsh) shell aliases.
#
# This is only for *shell-related shortcuts* which I might use in a
# terminal session. i3 and dmenu_run can't read aliases, so some things
# are stored as one-line files in my ~/bin.
#
# Anything that is a shortcut or something belongs here, rather than in
# my ~/bin, if it's only for my ease of use (e.g. tmpmux, since it can
# be achieved easily in another way
#

# allow aliases with 'sudo' prefixed -- pretty cool
alias sudo="sudo "

# useful ls aliases
alias ll="ls -lh"
alias la="ls -lah"
alias l="ls -la"

# so much git rite now
alias g="git"

# I do this so much, make it shorter
alias cm="git c -m"

# automatic ls to stop my habit
cdl() {
    cd $@
    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
        ls --color=auto
    fi
}

# shorter cdl so maybe I use it more plz
alias c="cdl"

# cd to the real path of current directory
real() {
    cd "$(realpath .)"
}

# run a command in a tmux session and exit when it finishes
# (literally a shortcut for `tmux new "args"`, but easier)
tmpmux() {
    # necessary to do this -- for some reason, can't just quote $@
    args="$@"

    tmux new-session "$args"

}

# quicker 'date now' command
alias d="date +%F"

# copy a file to the clipboard
alias clpb="xsel -i < "

# mount under current user w/ UTF8 for NTFS
# bash doesn't keep track of GID, so reuse UID
alias ntfsmount="mount -ouid=$UID,gid=$UID,utf8"
