# Non-specific/common (bash & zsh) shell aliases.
#
# This is only for shell-related shortcuts/aliases/etc. which I might
# use in a terminal session. i3 and dmenu_run can't read aliases, so
# some things are stored as one-line files in my ~/bin.
#
# Note: there are a few aliases I store as files in my ~/bin as well as
#       in here. This is because dmenu_run can't read aliases :(
