# vim: syntax=sh filetype=sh :

# Non-specific/common (bash & zsh) shell aliases.
#
# This is only for *shell-related shortcuts* which I might use in a
# terminal session. i3 and dmenu_run can't read aliases, so some things
# are stored as one-line files in my ~/bin.
#
# Note: there are a few aliases I store as files in my ~/bin as well as
#       in here. This is because dmenu_run can't read aliases :(
#

# allow aliases with 'sudo' prefixed -- pretty cool
alias sudo="sudo "

# useful ls aliases
alias ll="ls -lh"
alias la="ls -lah"
alias l="ls -la"

# I do this so much, make it shorter
alias cm="git c -m"

# automatic ls to stop my habit
cdl() {
    cd $@
    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
        ls --color=auto
    fi
}

# set terminal [emulator] title (a.k.a. xterm window title)
title() {
    echo -ne "\e]0;${@}\007"
}

# copy a file to the clipboard
alias clpb="xsel -i < "

# mount under current user
# bash doesn't keep track of GID, so reuse UID
