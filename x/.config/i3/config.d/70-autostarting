### Applications {{{
# Things to remember:
#
#   * prefix exec with a switch to the workspace you want the program on
#   * remember to title things when required by your layouts
#   * the selected window for a workspace seems pretty hard to set -
#     the order in which you start things might have an effect, but it
#     doesn't seem reliable

# auto terminal for scratchpad
for_window [title="^scratch$"] move scratchpad
exec $terminal --title "scratch"

assign [class="$editor_class"] $ws_text
exec $editor

assign [class="$browser_class"] $ws_www
exec $browser

$i3_msg 'workspace number $ws_comms; exec $mail'
$i3_msg 'workspace number $ws_comms; exec $terminal --title "irc" -e $term_irc'
$i3_msg 'workspace number $ws_media; exec $terminal --title "music" -e $term_music'
$i3_msg 'workspace number $ws_media; exec $terminal --title "news" -e $term_news'
#$i3_msg 'workspace number $ws_cal; exec $calendar'

### Layouts {{{
# Note: there is no point in using a layout if a workspace has just 1
#       window
#
# Remember to prefix the layout with a change to the wanted workspace!
# Keep in mind that the last workspace to have a layout appended to it
# will probably be the active one on startup.
#
$i3_msg 'workspace number $ws_comms; append_layout "$conf_dir/workspace-comms.json"'
$i3_msg 'workspace number $ws_media; append_layout "$conf_dir/workspace-media.json"'

# try our best to make a specific workspace active on startup
$i3_msg 'workspace number $ws_text'
