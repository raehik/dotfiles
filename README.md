My personal program configs
===========================

All files are stored in `home/` rather than in the root directory - otherwise,
you'd get this file and a couple others cluttering up your home directory.

To install, run `install`.

`EDIT_*` files will very likely require some other configuration. Search for
EDIT in them to find the important lines more quickly.


Structure
---------

  * `~/.assets`: things which change when I use my computers but should be the
    same across all, if possible

TODO etc.
